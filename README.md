# Smarty
### Extendable Framework for Bilingual and Multilingual Comprehension Assistants in C# 
by Todor Arnaudov - Tosh
http://twenkid.com

An intelligent dictionary, designed to integrate WordNet, BalkaNet and an ordinary dictionary databases with a rich GUI, tooltips and various NLP processing operations.

Originally developed in C# from scratch, about 9000 lines of code, written for about 3 months in the spring of 2007, during an undergraduate internship at the Wolverhampton University's Research Group in Computational Linguistics. Smarty was the most advanced and intelligent dictionary in late 2000s and probably in many years in 2010s. Many of Smarty's functions are now part in comprehension assistant dictionary-translation websites such as Reverso Contexts and others.

## News

**14.3.2024:** Smarty is revived, compiled again from a May 2007 version which was presented for the defence of the thesis. Now using SharpDevelop 2.2 :), the original .NET 2.0. The ancient plans for continuation will be finally executed, I hope so. Now it probably will be multilingual, multimodal etc. (...) and will be part of the AGI infrastructure Vsy, or **Jack of All Trades**. (...) I will protect the rest of the already clear details from the "competition", LOL, I thought of open sourcing it, maybe at some point, I don't know. Look forward for the releases and support me and The Sacred Computer!

* The binary application, the 2008 version 0.1 NB (Not Balkanet) with the original thesis, LREC 2008 and IMCSIT 2008 conference paper, presentation slides:

Version 0.1 NB (Aug 2008)
Re-release on 14.2.2021

https://github.com/Twenkid/Smarty/blob/master/Smarty_0-1NB-2008-Comprehension-Assistant-Release-2-2021.zip 

Dictionaries load automatically, a bigger text area, fixed bugs from the 2007 version etc.
Definitions of the multiword expressions in a tooltip etc.

__Known bug:__ Sometimes search endings doesn't show words which matched exactly the search, e.g. "ed" would not return "ed", but only longer words.

See also the Readme in the archive.

There were some bugs in the archive, missing or broken files.

Run Smarty.Exe, Select File ->  Load Dictionary
See Readme.txt and the /README folder.

A newer version of the program existed, released in 2008. It fixed a few bugs and had functions to measure time for queries (if not mistaken) - needed for the paper. The link was gone after migration, I'll try to dig it out.
