# Smarty
Extendable Framework for Bilingual and Multilingual Comprehension Assistants in C#

An intelligent dictionary, designed to integrate WordNet, BalkaNet and an ordinary dictionary text database with a rich GUI, tooltips and various NLP processing operations.

Originally developed in C# from scratch, about 9000 lines of code, written for about 3 months in the spring of 2007, during an undergraduate internship at the Wolverhampton University's Research Group in Computational Linguistics.

Run Smarty.Exe, Select File ->  Load Dictionary
See Readme.txt and the /README folder.

A newer version of the program existed, released in 2008. It fixed a few bugs and had functions to measure time for queries (if not mistaken) - needed for the paper. The link was gone after migration, I'll try to dig it out.
